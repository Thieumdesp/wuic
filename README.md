## Welcome to WUIC (Web UI Compressor) 

Please take a look at the website's project [here](http://gdrouet.github.io/wuic/).

## TODO

- Create separate module for EhCache and YUICompressor
- Wrap exception in specific exception for XML support
- Implicit workflow for heap not referenced by workflow
- Heap could be defined with other heaps
- Review words in variables and comments : group become heap/workflow, resource become nut and resource factory become nut dao
- Create embedded JS minifier, CSS minfier, in memory cache and GZIP compressor
- Add timeout for tests that wait and sleep
