##### v0.3.2 #####

Tacked issues : https://github.com/gdrouet/wuic/issues?labels=0.3.2&page=1&state=closed

Not tracked issues :

##### v0.3.3 #####

Tacked issues : https://github.com/gdrouet/wuic/issues?labels=0.3.3&page=1&state=closed

Not tracked issues :
- Each time a steam's resource is retrieved, we look up for it, which increase the overhead. This look up is now done only one time when the resource is created.

Breaking changes :
- 'file' parameter not supported anymore in URL pattern, use this one instead : /[groupId]/[fileName]

##### v0.3.4 #####

Tacked issues : https://github.com/gdrouet/wuic/issues?labels=0.3.4&page=1&state=closed

Not tracked issues :
- More robust url builder to deal with some cases where configuration properties that are used to build some URLs don't contain "/"
- When YUICompressor is used, temporary file was created. Now everything is done in memory for better performances
- Resource path needed to ends with a supported file extension even if it was a regex. Test is now performed on physical resources and allows to indicates path like .*
